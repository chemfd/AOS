# TA Transient Absorption {#ch:TA}

Transient absorption is a technique which looks at the absorption of an excited state (and consequently also the loss (or bleaching) of the ground state). The technique is used at a variety of wavelength ranges only changing the probe wavelength to the range of interest. The most common versions of this teachnique are using ~infra~-red probes and UV/visable probes, and usually the technique is time-resolved, frequently in the ns, ps & fs time domains.
