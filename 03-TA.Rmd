# TA Transient Absorption {#ch:TA}

Transient absorption is a technique which looks at the absorption of an excited state (and consequently also the loss (or bleaching) of the ground state, Table \@ref(tab:phototrans)). 

The technique is based off the single wavelength time resolved technique flash photolysis which was developed by, and won the Nobel Prize for, George Porter and Ronald Norrish (figure \@ref(fig:flash)). In flash photolysis a single wavelength probe is normally used, the monochromator in figure \@ref(fig:flash) is frequently just a band pass filter rather than the traditional multi component monochromator, other occasions a long pass filter is used with much the same effect.

```

The technique looks at either the bleaching and recovery of a ground state, or else at the formation and decay of an excited state, these decay or recovery curves may then be fitted to first order kinetics (figure \@ref(fig:flashdecay).

```{r echo=FALSE, flashdecay, out.width='60%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Flash photolysis gives kinetic profiles which either show the formation and decay of an excited state (top) or bleach and recovery of a ground state (bottom).'}

```

The technique is used at a variety of wavelength ranges only changing the probe wavelength to the range of interest. The most common versions of this teachnique are using ~infra~-red probes and UV/visable probes, and usually the technique is time-resolved, frequently in the ns, ps & fs time domains. We will look at other lifetime techniques later in the course, and different lifetime teachniques are often used in conjunction to more fully understand a system.

## Absorbance transitions

In transient absorbtion we look at the absorption spectra from excited excited states, and under usual circumstances look at how this evolves over time, just like with a ground state absorbance you can have absorption to a number of different levels and these

However, the excited state is also lost by the usual deactivation pathways listed in Table \@ref(tab:photoem), and so we can use kinetics to follow the loss of excited state and either the reformation of the ground state or formation of products.

There are a number of transient excited states which may be observed in transient absorption spectrum which may not be accessible by direct absorption of a photon from the ground state, these states occur at different time delays, and we can often follow pathways of formation of different states.

## Lifetimes in TA

If we study the the TA spectrum with excitation pulses of different durations we get to see different information about the system.

- fs - non-radiative relaxation of higher electronic states and the transition state formation
- ps - vibrational relaxation
- ps-ns - radiative relaxation of first excited singlet state (fluorescence)
- Âµs - spin-forbidden relaxation of first excited triplet state (phosphorescence)
- ms - fast photocycles (photolyase, phytochrome, rhodopsin)

Photochemical reactions can occur on all of these time scales

The time resolution is determined by the instrument response function (IRF) which is a response of the pump duration and the detector response and refresh rate.

The decay profiles always follow (spontaneous) first order kinetics, however there may be more than one decay mechanism from any given state, each with their own unique lifetime (\@ref(eq:polyexp)).

\begin{equation}
[S*]=A \textrm{e}^{-k_1t}+ B \textrm{e}^{-k_2t} \dots
(\#eq:polyexp)
\end{equation}

It is relatively easy to fit to bi-exponential decay, however if there are three or more components fitting the lifetimes gets increasingly difficult and so lifetimes with more than three components are only rarely reported.
